# Multi-Scale Attention Network

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Multi-Scale Attention Network for enhancing feature extraction in deep learning models. The network leverages attention mechanisms at multiple scales to improve performance on complex tasks such as image classification and object detection.

### Features

- Multi-scale feature extraction using attention layers
- Support for deep learning frameworks (PyTorch-based implementation)
- Modular and easy-to-extend architecture
- Efficient training and inference with GPU acceleration

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration)
- Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mavis107/Multi-scale_attention_network.git
    cd Multi-scale_attention_network
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

Run the training script with default configurations:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 16 --lr 0.001
```

### Inference
Use the trained model to make predictions:
```bash
python inference.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --model_path path/to/trained_model.pth
```
